@W: MT529 :"\\siglabsmachine\shared\daryl-workspace\lattice\test2\sparse_mult_by_a.sv":87:0:87:8|Found inferred clock sparse_mult_by_A|i_clock which controls 2139 sequential elements including fillup_transition. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
