@W: MT529 :"\\siglabsmachine\shared\daryl-workspace\lattice\test1\impl1\source\skid.sv":46:0:46:5|Found inferred clock top_skid|i_clock which controls 76 sequential elements including skid_0_inst.o_out_valid. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
